<h1>Seelie Court</h1>
<p align="center">
<b>Location:</b> West <FONT COLOR="#F0EFEB">///</FONT> <b>Kingdom:</b> Finias
</p>
<b>Culture:</b> Their entire society is centered around the idea that power is the most important value. Western Fae fight for a place of honor, pitting against each other in fair duels. All disagreements between their people, and even important disputes such as land ownership or proof of fraud, are fought for on the battlefield or in an arena. The strong overcome and devour the weak, forcing them to adapt to the harsh conditions of their literal and political climate. As cruel and uninviting as that all sounds they are surprisingly a kindhearted and happy-go-lucky people outside of battle. Other cultures are acknowledged as equally important, but only outside of their own borders. An immigrant or traveler passing through might see just as much prejudice as they would compassion.

<div id="tab3">
<h1>History & Lore</h1>
Queen Titania's story starts the same as all the other original Monarchs, having been "birthed" by The Dream into a role of leadership. Unlike the rest she was not uplifted by her people. Finias follows a code of honor that dictates if one is worthy of leading they must become the strongest in the land. Titania worked herself up the ladder and remains their most powerful warrior to this day, asserting her dominance as High Queen. During the invasion she stayed and fought with her people, and lived on to lead the Revolution. When their cause was betrayed and they all fell she was dragged into captivity, only to rise again fighting when The Butterfly initiated the Uprising.
<br><br>
She awoke into existence alone, granted no relatives of any kind by the Dream. This remained to be the case for nearly the entirety of her life, not even taking on temporary lovers or anything of the sort. Eventually she fell in love with the Northern Prince who, despite her objections, chose to leave his Kingdom behind to pursue a future with her. Sir Spriggan eventually became strong enough in the Finias community to be dubbed the Queen's Royal Knight, finally allowing them to be married. Titania has only recently discovered she is in very early stages of pregnancy.

<h1>Firstborn Sidhe</h1>
<b>Immortality</b><br>
The First Generation Faeries were "born" into one single physical age and remain that age eternally. They can die from anything except natural causes. 
<br><br>
<b>Mana Sensitivity</b><br>
The Fae-kind are very sensitive to auras and mana, allowing them to feel or see when another being is drawing from their mana pool or activating their mana, even if something is blocking their vision, a faint outline of an aura can be seen--or sensed--so long as the fellow magic user is within a twenty foot radius of the Fae. She cannot tell how much mana is being used or the user has left over, she is merely sensitive to when it is currently in use within the radius. 
<br><br>
<b>Enhanced Speed</b><br>
The body of the Fae-kind is light, petite, and athletic. They can move double the speed of the average human and the strongest Fae's speeds can rival that of a hummingbird's. 
<br><br>
<b>Enhanced Flexibility</b><br>
Their bodies are as flexible as they are light, allowing them to contort their shapes into absurd formations. Something someone would expect to see in a circus act. 
<br><br>
<b>Burning Calories</b><br>
The Fae-kind eat thousands upon thousands of calories on purpose and burn them off very quickly. Physical sugary foods is said to help their mental and magic stability, often allowing them slightly faster mana regeneration than what is average if consumed when their mana-pool is either completely drained or close to it. 
<br><br>
<b>Hidden Wings</b><br>
Tribal-like wing markings cover the backs of the Fae-kind. These tribal markings cause various different kinds of winged silhouettes to form as an aura behind each individual Faerie when they dip into their mana pool. 
<br><br>
<b>Advanced Perception</b><br>
Rather than rise in the ranks of typical physical speed, her mind processes actions and comes up with a reaction twice as fast as the average human's. 
<br><br>
<b>Enhanced Strength</b><br>
Years of physical training have paid off. Faeries always had the capacity to be physically strong despite their average dainty figures. This Faerie is now twice as strong as the average human, thanks to the years of hard work and the significant rise in power.

<h1>Magus Manatism</h1>
<i>"The epitome of mana manipulation. Those that take this tree end up taking their skills in this art to levels so ridiculous they can solidify their mana into all shapes and sizes. Manatists start off with an advanced form of mana manipulation that makes them just a bit more adept at Paige rank with their skill than others. This of course doesn't stop being a fact as they rank up and as they learn spells, but lose their edge as their peers get more experienced. With their inate ability at mana manipulation, they are able to learn universal spells that are meant for those a rank above them and below.  Without a question of a doubt, their trump card comes in the form of an advanced form of mana, the purest a mage could possibly make. Arcane energy is a very volatile and destructive force, one that takes much time to master but is fully worth the journey from Expert Mage to the upper ranks available to mages. Some even say its power cannot be matched at its zenith."</i>

<h1>Umbrakinesis</h1>
<i>"Users of Radiance must choose between the ultimate duality; to manipulate the light itself, or manifest their power through the darkness of shadows. Dark Radiance, also known as Umbrakinesis (Ulreich), focuses more on creating solid shadows and manipulating the darkness itself to ones advantage. [...] The reverse is true with Umbrakinetic mages, who unlock Darkness Energy at Expert mage, a power that allows them to destroy mana within a target creature who becomes exposed to it's negative properties."</i>
